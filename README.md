# Blackjack-in-Assembly
I made a game of Black-Jack using the CPUlator Nios ll DE10-Lite System Simulator. This can be found for free at the CPUlator website. I developed this project while attending Columbia State Community College. I utilized LEDs, Push Buttons, and the JTAG UART. The LEDs are a simple stand in for chips, to track points. I used the pushed buttons for players to indicate hit or stand. As for the JTAG UART, it conveys the state of the game so the player understands what is going on.

While most of the code is mine, our professor Marvin Johnson gave us programs to work with as we complete our projects. These programs are cited at the bottom, like the random number generator.
